# Tell Show

This is a simple script to remind me of when my favorite shows are on. 

A single python script (and a single `.tell_show` file) are all that are needed.

The script can be run manually, or you can automate the script with `crontab -e` on \*nix systems

You can have the script send you results to your email or phone (Twitter, Pushbullet, etc), but I have not included these extra files because I did not want to share my personal API keys.
